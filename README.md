*R7.Dnn.Extensions.EFCore* is a library for DNN Platform web CMS extensions development which allow you to use
[Entity Framework Core](https://github.com/aspnet/EntityFrameworkCore) as O/RM backend via abstractions
provided by [R7.Dnn.Extensions](https://github.com/roman-yagodin/R7.Dnn.Extensions) base library.

Currently it's based on EF Core version 1.1.1, so it could be used along with [2sxc](https://github.com/2sic/2sxc) without problems.
